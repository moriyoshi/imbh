# Project To-Dos

Items extracted from JOURNAL.md during `good-sleep` consolidation, plus open follow-ups. Each
item should be resolved or removed once addressed. Design-level open *questions* (as opposed to
actionable work) live in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §15, not here.

Completed items are swept periodically (their durable knowledge lives in `.agents/docs/LTM/` and
git history); this file tracks only what is still open.

## Open Items

- [ ] **Optional upstream differential runner.** Automate the versioned in-process fixture corpus
      against pinned Prometheus/Loki/Tempo daemons behind an opt-in test or script. Default
      workspace tests must remain daemon-free and offline. Deferred by explicit user request. —

## Recently Swept (2026-07-24 good-sleep)

Six items completed on 2026-07-24 were removed from the open list; their durable knowledge is in
LTM:

| Item | Where the knowledge lives now |
|------|-------------------------------|
| PromQL lookback lower-bound fidelity | `LTM/imbh-lgtm-languages-and-arrow-reads.md` |
| TraceQL negated-matcher-on-missing-attribute | `LTM/imbh-lgtm-languages-and-arrow-reads.md` |
| `imbh-lgtm` examples lack `required-features = ["source"]` | `LTM/imbh-lgtm-languages-and-arrow-reads.md` |
| Async `queued` receipt carried `lsn = Lsn(0)` | `LTM/storage-engine.md` (`Lsn` is `NonZero<u64>`) |
| TUI terminal teardown gaps | `LTM/imbh-tui-and-gen-demo-db.md` |
| `query_batches` duplicate definition under `--all-features` | `LTM/query-engine-and-typed-apis.md` |
| Git staging split before the first commit (resolved; history has since been amended) | git history |
